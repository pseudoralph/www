ENERGY SECURITY, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND ENERGY EQUITY.*  Many initiatives, policies, even laws, when successful in Germany are being recommended to debate, adapt and implement in other European countries, the European Union members. Talking about the energy efficiency, the development of European standards, when successful, helps to enhance international and regional cooperation, in addition to regional testing and harmonization facilities and certifications. Energy efficiency study, understanding and ideally promotion and implementation is the win-win strategy. In the global pursuit of energy affordability, energy security, energy efficiency stands out as perhaps the single most promising resource.  An energy efficient asset, whether a factory or a private residence, has a higher asset value and better conditions. It is advisable to seek an advice from professionals before potential decision on an acquisition of any property / business in Germany.  It might not be possible for all to study French in France or Opera in Salzburg. It might and, I strongly believe is possible, to apply and be accepted for conferences and workshops on Renewable Energy at the Renewables Academy(RENAC) in Berlin Since the RENAC’s founding in 2008, more than 6,000 participants from 145 countries worldwide have participated in one of their training programs. This is where I met Lars Imroth and Roland Zimmermann in October 2013. They teach at RENAC. They taught hundreds of industry professionals from all around the globe that arrive to Berlin with a mission to get to know more about the Energy Efficiency Made in Germany.

It was later in the afternoon when a few people congregated there with books spread out so they could study while drinking coffee or snacking. Many tables were empty, yet after Lynn had been sitting for a few moments, an elderly man sat down across from her. The old man seemed familiar to Lynn, though, at first, she pretended to ignore him. He said nothing, just sat there as someone might when all the tables are filled and it is necessary to share space with a stranger. His presence made her uncomfortable, yet there was nothing specific that alerted her. A short while later, Mac, the man who had been Lynn's handler in Mexico, came out of the shadows and stopped at the table. He was younger than the old man. His clothes were military casual, the type of garments that veteran students who have military experience might recognise, but not think unusual. He leaned over Lynn and kissed her gently on the forehead, spoke quietly to her, and then said 'Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.' Those were the code words that would start the cover programme of which she was still part. The words led to her being switched from the control of the old man, a researcher she now believes may have been part of Dr Ewen Cameron's staff before coming to the United States for the latter part of his career, to the younger man. The change is like a re-enlistment in an army she never willingly joined.
